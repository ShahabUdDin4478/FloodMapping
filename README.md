# FloodMapping
                       SAR-FLOOD MAPPING USING A CHANGE DETECTION APPROACH
  ===========================================================================================
  Within this script SAR Sentinel-1 is being used to generate a flood extent map. A change 
  detection approach was chosen, where a before- and after-flood event image will be compared. 
  Sentinel-1 GRD imagery is being used. Ground Range Detected imagery includes the following 
  preprocessing steps: Thermal-Noise Removal, Radiometric calibration, Terrain-correction 
  hence only a Speckle filter needs to be applied in the preprocessing.
